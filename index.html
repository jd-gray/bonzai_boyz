          <h2>Chef Jon Hing</h2>
			  	<p>As a native Arizonan, Chef Jon has grown up and been inspired by food all of his life. Some of his fondest memories revolve around helping to cook dinners with his mom and grandma and all the excitement around  being apart of his aunt’s Chinese restaurant. Jon was continually amazed by the transformation of ingredients into delicious dishes, expanding his exploration into all different types of cuisines.</p>
          <p>Jon attended Arizona State University and earned his  degrees in Accounting and Computer Information Systems, but never lost his desire to cook. Luckily for his roommates, Jon often made meals for everyone.After graduating,he worked for 7 years as a CPA and Audit Manager with a national accounting firm before he made the decision to follow his passion in the fine art of food. He took the leap of faith and enrolled at Arizona Culinary Institute. Shortly after graduation, Jon landed an entry level position as a Pantry Cook at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion restaurant in Chandler. Jon’s hands-on skills and formal culinary training helped him to advance quickly as he advanced to a Sous Chef after two and a half years and eventually became the Chef Partner. </p>

          <h2>Chef Leong Yam</h2>
			  	<p>Originally from Malaysia, Chef Leong has spent most of his childhood in Arizona. Gaining his first experiences from his father, Leong knew he wanted to work with food. During his time in the Culinary Arts program at the Art Institute of Phoenix, Leong participated in cooking competitions as well cooking and serving in an active restaurant at the school. He also worked part-time at Starbucks and The Cheesecake Factory while in school.</p>
          <p>After graduation, Leong accepted a position as Sous Chef at Paul Lee’s Chinese Kitchen. He also expanded his experience by working for non-traditional food places such as a Sushi Chef at AJ’s Fine Foods and a Sous Chef at Banner Desert Medical Center. These experiences gave Chef Leong further exposure to different ingredients, nutritional concepts,  customers and ways of service (catering and event service) Leong is also a fan of international travel, visiting many Asian countries and gaining a great deal of his inspiration from these countries.  Most recently, Leong serves as the Executive Chef at Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion Restaurant; using his skills, experience and knowledge to continue to ‘wow’ his guests.</p>

          <h2>Javi Mogollon</h2>
			  	<p>Chef Javi's love for cooking started at a young age watching his mom cook authentic Mexican food at home. This curiosity developed into his passion as he built his career as a Chef in the restaurant industry. Javi has 30+ years of experience in numerous positions working for companies such as Olive Garden, Applebee's, and Bahama Breeze.</p>
          <p>In 2006, he started working at Roy's Hawaiian Fusions with Jon and Leong - working together for over 10 years. Javi was promoted to Executive Chef after Jon and Leong moved on to start the food trucks. When Roy's closed its doors in 2021, Javi became the Executive Chef at Pedal House Phoenix. We are excited that Javi has decided to rejoin the Boyz in late 2022 to expand our reach and availability to serve the culinary needs of the valley.</p>
