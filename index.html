          <h2>Chef Jon Hing</h2>
			  	<p>As a native Arizonan, Chef Jon has grown up and been inspired by food all of his life. Some of his fondest memories revolve around helping to cook dinners with his mom and grandma and all the excitement around  being apart of his aunt’s Chinese restaurant. Jon was continually amazed by the transformation of ingredients into delicious dishes, expanding his exploration into all different types of cuisines.</p>
          <p>Jon attended Arizona State University and earned his  degrees in Accounting and Computer Information Systems, but never lost his desire to cook. Luckily for his roommates, Jon often made meals for everyone.After graduating,he worked for 7 years as a CPA and Audit Manager with a national accounting firm before he made the decision to follow his passion in the fine art of food. He took the leap of faith and enrolled at Arizona Culinary Institute. Shortly after graduation, Jon landed an entry level position as a Pantry Cook at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion restaurant in Chandler. Jon’s hands-on skills and formal culinary training helped him to advance quickly as he advanced to a Sous Chef after two and a half years and eventually became the Chef Partner. </p>
